# Xbox-360-Gamertag-API

This is the *old version* of the Xbox 360 Gamertag API web scraper. The more modern version is written in Python, available on Google App Engine, and can be found at https://github.com/flotwig/360api-gae. This repository is kept here for historical purposes and should not be used, the code is bad.

That being said, if you want to prop up a version of this on your own server, just drop it in to your PHP-enabled webroot and make requests to ?gamertag=whatever to get a JSON response.
